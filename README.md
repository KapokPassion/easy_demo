This security system achieves secure transmission of passwords by preventing attackers from brute force cracking and man in the middle attacks through two rounds of asymmetric encryption and access frequency control; Secondly, this dual encryption algorithm is used to achieve dynamic token computation, avoiding attackers from using man in the middle attacks to obtain tokens and then disguising IP addresses for direct online operations; This security system protects the database by executing data table backup plans, data table restore operations, and SQL injection detection on the backend, preventing password leakage or password cracking that can cause online data to be modified and destroyed; Finally, this security system sets triggers on the database to prohibit high-risk operations and proactively backs up the database before medium risk operations occur, generating alerts to prevent attackers from directly attacking the data table.
